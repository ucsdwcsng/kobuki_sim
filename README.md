# kobuki_sim

This repository is for running cartographer mapping simulations of the kobuki robot. You will be able to run a simulation of a robot moving across an enviornment, then map the enviornment using the IMU and Lidar data, then test the accuracy of the map by comparing the localized trajectory of the robot with the actual trajectory.
